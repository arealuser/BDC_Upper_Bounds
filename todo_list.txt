Fix bug where when the number of processors used is not a power of 2 BAA crashes.
Add more efficient bit channel probability cache-based computation - Done.
	Compute backend tables.
	Add them to the CPP code.
	Test the resulting distribution to ensure that the faster computation is correct.
Utilize the symmetries for even faster BAA steps:
	NOT symmetry should be easy. - Done
	Flip symmetry may be harder because of palindromic input strings.
Finish analyzing and add run-based channel to code.
